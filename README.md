# Ethical Hacking Programs
This is my first repository consisting of various hacking tools and malwares. I wrote these Python programs while learning **Ethical Hacking**. There are a total of 16 programs which are as follows:
- MAC Address Changer
- Network Scanner
- ARP Spoofer
- Packet Sniffer
- DNS Spoofer
- Download Replacer
- Code Injector
- ARP Spoofing Detector
- Trojan
- Password Stealer
- Backdoor
- Backdoor Shell Listener
- Keylogger
- Web Crawler
- Password Cracker
- XSS Vulnerability Scanner

*DISCLAIMER - These programs were created for educational and ethical purposes only and all the attacks were launched in my own lab or against devices that I had permission to test. I do not take responsibility of these being used maliciously for execution and/or causing damages.*
